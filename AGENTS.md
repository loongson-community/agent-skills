This repository hosts reusable AI agent skills maintained by the Loongson open-source community.

**Before making any changes, read the contributing guide that matches the predominant language of the current user session:**

- **中文会话** → [docs/contributing-guide.zh.md](docs/contributing-guide.zh.md)
- **English session** → [docs/contributing-guide.en.md](docs/contributing-guide.en.md)

If the session language is unclear, default to the Chinese version.

The contributing guide covers project structure, content workflows, code style, commit message conventions, AIGC policy compliance, and the validation checklist. All of those rules are authoritative and must be followed.
